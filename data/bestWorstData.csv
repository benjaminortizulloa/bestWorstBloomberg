The teams conducted independent research and used surveys and telephone interviews to get additional data and verify the accuracy of their findings. We started with members of predominant national benchmark indexes, such as the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500, FTSE 350 and Nikkei 225 Stock Average. We eliminated banks with market capitalizations of less than $10 billion as of Sept. 15 and those with insufficient data on their environmental activities.

In the clean-energy investment category, which accounts for 70 percent of the score, we assessed support for clean-energy projects including wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, biomass/biofuels and related technologies. We divided the efforts into public- and private-equity investments, debt issuance, advisory services and tax equity. We ranked the projects from highest to lowest based on the total installed electricity-generating capacity of the investments in megawatts, total dollars invested and total deal count.  The second consideration, reducing environmental impact, accounts for 30 percent of the score. We looked at the banks' reductions in air emissions and water use and at gains in energy efficiency. We used a three-year-momentum approach, with the most recent data receiving the greatest weight. Banks with more aggressive and mature programs and with measurable, multiyear declines in greenhouse emissions and water and energy consumption earned the most points. Banks that disclosed more data got more credit.

This year we introduced a coal energy component. We tallied the number and value of a bank's deals in coal industry projects. We included equity and equity-linked investments, bonds and loan financings. We assigned four levels of penalty points to reflect a bank's involvement with coal, then adjusted the overall score to reflect the negative points.

Throughout the ranking, each data point was peer ranked on a scale of zero to 100. For example, in underwriting activities, the banks reporting the highest-dollar-value deals received the highest scores. Those scores were multiplied by the weight assigned to that category to determine the overall value in the section. This was done for every grouping to determine a total score for the clean-energy and environmental-impact categories.",Bloomberg,2014-09-16
